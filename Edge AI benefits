How Edge AI Improves Real-Time Applications

                Benefit                                    Explanation
                 Low latency                                Inference happens on-device, no internet delays.
                 Privacy	                                  Images never leave the device (good for sensitive environments).
                 Reduced bandwidth	                         No need to upload video streams to the cloud.
                 High availability                         	 Works without internet—critical for safety systems.
                 Lower cost	                                 Fewer cloud compute resources required.
